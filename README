Firestarter Engine

The engine design borrows heavily from the Intel article, "Designing the Framework of a Parallel Game Enigne"

For now, the engine doesn't do much...


Required libraries for compiling:
 - libgl
 - libglew
 - libsdl
 - boost-thread
 - boost-chrono
 - boost-system
 - boost-python
 
Additionally, UnitTest++ is needed for the testcases


To build the project on Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal), you will need Code::Blocks and the required libraries:
apt-get install codeblocks # CodeBlocks uses it's own build system instead of make
apt-get install libglew1.6-dev libsdl1.2-dev # Required for compiling the engine
apt-get install libboost-thread1.50-dev libboost-system1.50-dev libboost-chrono1.50-dev libboost-python1.50-dev
apt-get install libunittest++-dev # Optional, required for compiling the test cases

To build the project on Windows, you will need Code::Blocks, and a MinGW build environment with the required libraries.
