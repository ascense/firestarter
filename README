Firestarter Engine

For now, the engine doesn't do much...

Required libraries for compiling:
 - libgl
 - libglew
 - libsdl

 Additionally, UnitTest++ is needed for the testcases


To build the project on Ubuntu, you will need Code::Blocks and the required libraries:
apt-get install codeblocks # CodeBlocks uses it's own build system instead of make
apt-get install libglew1.6-dev libsdl1.2-dev # Required for compiling the engine
apt-get install libunittest++-dev # Optional, required for compiling the test cases


 The engine design borrows heavily from the Intel article, "Designing the Framework of a Parallel Game Enigne"
